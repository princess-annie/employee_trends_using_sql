## Workforce Analytics: Exploring Trends Using SQL
This project analyzes an HR dataset of approximately 3,000 employees 
to identify workforce trends and generate insights into employee performance and workforce management.

## Data Structure
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and provided as CSV files. The dataset is structured into four relational tables and
all files were imported into a MySQL database and organized into the following relational tables:
*employee_data table
*employee_survey_data table
*recruitment_data table
*training_and_development_data table
It captures key workforce attributes such as demographics, job roles, performance ratings, engagement levels, and hiring outcomes.
The dataset is designed to support workforce analytics, employee performance evaluation, engagement analysis, and data-driven HR decision-making.
n/b: All tables were sucessfully loaded with no data loss/corruption

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The database is designed using a relational model centered around the Employees table.
Employee records are linked to training, survey, and recruitment data through primary and foreign key relationships.
This structure supports efficient querying and scalable workforce analytics.
